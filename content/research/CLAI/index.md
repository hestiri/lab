Our goal at CLAI is to integrate *phenomenological theory* and *clinical knowledge* with state-of-the-art *Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence* methods to **develop enriched computational models of human phenotypes.** 

We focus on a Thinkin’ (i.e., specialized, time-aware, data-centric, interpretable, portable, and fair) AI where AI refers to `Augmented Intelligence`.

"The AMA House of Delegates uses the term augmented intelligence (AI) as a conceptualization of artificial intelligence that focuses on AI’s assistive role, emphasizing that its design enhances human intelligence rather than replaces it."
