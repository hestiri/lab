We seek a highly motivated and collaborative Postdoctoral Fellow/Research Scientist with strong machine learning (ML) background and a desire to conduct research at the intersection of ML and health to join the Clinical Augmented Intelligence Group (CLAI). 

Our group conducts research on integrating clinical knowledge with AI/ML methods to develop enriched computational models of human phenotypes. Led by Dr. Hossein Estiri, an Assistant Professor at HMS, CLAI resides within the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Department of Medicine. As the largest hospital-based research program in the world, MGH enables CLAI research to leverage state-of-the-art large-scale clinical data for developing specialized AL/ML methods to enrich human phenotype models. We currently apply these methods to model Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).

The applicant will work with CLAI faculty and staff as well as collaborate closely with an interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians within the Mass General Brigham system and Harvard community that partner on CLAI research. 


**Qualifications**

An ideal candidate will have a background in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, or a related field. A Ph.D. degree or equivalent is required. In addition, she or he has strong research skills in transfer learning, generative latent-variable models, representation learning, and MLOps, and will have demonstrated an outstanding capability for independent research. Strong programming skills and a solid publication track in top-tier machine learning, AI conferences or other top-tier ML for healthcare conferences and journals is desirable.
Duties will include conducting original research, publishing in top-tier clinical and machine learning journals/conferences, mentoring students, and collaborating on research grant proposal writing.

**How to Apply**

To apply, please send us your application and reference letters:

The application should include:
