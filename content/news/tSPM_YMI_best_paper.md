Our JAMIA paper ([High-throughput phenotyping with temporal sequences](https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa288)) is picked by  the International Medical Informatics Association as the best Clinical Research Informatics paper in 2020 (out of 877 papers).

> *"[...] The first best paper of the CRI section, from Estiri et al. demonstrates how the use of a vector sequential representation of the EHR data combined with a novel sequential pattern mining (SPM) algorithm to characterize temporal relationships between EHR data instances - in particular diagnoses, complications and medications - significantly improves the performance of a high throughput algorithm to predict 10 phenotypes."*
