summary: 'The confluence of extreme heat cold on the health and longevity of an Aging Population with Alzheimers and related Dementia'
title: R01 Grant funded by NIA

---

We just received an R01 award from the National Institute of Aging to study the confluence of extreme weather events on the aging population living with Alzheimers (AD) and related Dementia (ADRD).

This is a collaboration between CLAI, Dr. Chirag Patel ([Chirag Patel's Group](https://www.chiragjpgroup.org/)) from HMS Department of Biomedical Informatics, and Dr. Francesca Dominici ([faculty profile](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/francesca-dominici/)).
