Our goal at CLAI is to integrate *phenomenological theory* and *clinical knowledge* with state-of-the-art *Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence* methods to **develop enriched computational models of human phenotypes.** We are pursuing these goals through 3 research foci:

**1- Clinical.** Incorporating clinical knowledge and informatics approaches to develop phenotype models (for cohort classification and predictions) using clinical data, especially data stored in electronic health record systems.

**2- Computational.**  Developing and validating Thinkinâ€™ (i.e., specialized, time-aware, data-centric, interpretable, portable, and fair) ML/AI systems to enable precision medicine.

**3- Temporal.** Leveraging temporal information in digital records to enrich computational models of evolving and complex human phenotypes.
